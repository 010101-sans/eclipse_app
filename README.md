# Eclipse Demo

This Flutter app titled as "Cosmic Shadow" is created as part of the "NASA Space Apps Challenge" by our team, "Lunavate"!

The app provides a visual demonstration of both "Solar Eclipse" and "Lunar Eclipse" scenarios, allowing users to observe the dynamic interplay between the Sun, Earth, and Moon within an infinite space filled with shining stars.

The top-view representation of the geometric motion of the Moon orbiting the Earth is presented beautifully. The app accurately depicts shadows cast on both the Moon and Earth, effectively illustrating the occurrences of Solar and Lunar Eclipses.

## Features

  - Visual representation of Solar and Lunar Eclipses.
  - Realistic depiction of the Sun, Earth, and Moon in motion (The distances and sizes of planets are "NOT TO SCALE").
  - Top-view display of eclipse patterns.
  - Accurate rendering of shadow effects.

## Usage

The app provides an educational and visual experience to help users understand the dynamics of Solar and Lunar Eclipses.
The users can also interact with moon revolution by dragging it.
